How To Find Polyamorous Partners The Ultimate Guide From daterboy.com
Polyamory is very different than polygamy, which is the practice of having more than one spouse at the same time, typically a wife, and is usually rooted in religious beliefs. Polyamory emphasizes consciously choosing what percentage partners one wishes to be involved instead of accepting social norms which dictate loving just one person at a time. This is when polyamorists have multiple relationships but do not become intertwined with the other people. This means that polyamorous people find emotional fulfillment by not limiting themselves or their partners to one significant other.
