What Size Sink Do I Need for My Kitchen? From thewowstyle.com
It isn’t my personal favorite, but i get why people want it there. Having dishes, either dirty or clean, on display on your island can be a big turn off for many people. I reluctantly went for sink in island as i do have the whole range/overmantle/chimney thing. If you are going to have seating, i would use the island for prep, maybe put the coffeepot there, but not a place for dirty dishes or grease spatters.
