It refers to poly relationships where everyone in the polycule is comfortable sitting together at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee. As jess mahler says, “they can share a cup of coffee.” compare this to parallel polyamory, where partners of partners (metamours) may not even meet, or what rebecca hiles calls “birthday party polyamory,” where everyone may not get along one hundred percent of the time, but they damn. If the kitchen table unit is a literal living together unit, the nesting partners might feel like the outside of the unit partner gets the “fun time,” or “more dates;” and the person on the outside might feel negativity or jealousy about not getting time to “just veg,” less time with their partner in the hinge’s home. There are a lot of different ways to do polyamory, and a lot of ways to describe it.
