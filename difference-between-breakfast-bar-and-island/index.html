The kitchen has an island breakfast bar! Kitchen decor From pinterest.com
When a kitchen island with a breakfast bar isn�t providing a convenient place to catch up on the news or grab a quick meal, it also multitasks as extra countertop space for prep work or homework. The main difference is that it attaches either to the existing countertop or comes out of a wall, having a maximum of three usable sides. A typical breakfast bar counter has a standard height of 42 inches (107 centimeters) and a depth/countertop overhang of 12 to 16 inches (30 to 40 centimeters). These areas are usually raised above the standard kitchen worktop height.
