Standard Kitchen Sizes Designs From morganallendesigns.com
Standard upper kitchen cabinets are 30, 36, or 42 inches in height and 12 or 24 inches in depth. The standard floor cabinet depth is 580mm inclusive of door thickness. At premier kitchens we have increased our cabinet depth by 50mm to allow for modern day sinks and tapware that require more room. Subsequently, the sink is almost always the same height as the kitchen counter height for obvious reasons.
