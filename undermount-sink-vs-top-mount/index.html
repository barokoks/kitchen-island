Topmount vs Undermount Sinks Which sink should I choose From youtube.com
What is an undermount sink? When your cooking area sink is big and deep, you will not deal with any type of trouble when come to filling it with water. If you got it, flaunt it, and go with the undermount. That means that someone can measure up and then use a jigsaw to cut the hole for the sink, it doesn�t need to look nice but the hole needs to just be big enough to fit the sink but small enough to have the lips.
