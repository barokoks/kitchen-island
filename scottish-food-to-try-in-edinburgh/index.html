Oats are one of the few grains that grow well in the north of scotland and were, until the 20th century, the staple grain used. It’s almost inevitable that you’ll be trying this traditional scottish breakfast during your visit. There�s a variety of fresh fish to sample, including atlantic salmon, trout and pollock, not to mention an abundance of mussels and oysters. Now that this basement restaurant in stockbridge opens only on fridays and saturdays, those in search of edinburgh’s best margaritas (£7.30) and nachos (£3.65) will have to keep weekends clear.
