The minimum recommended width of a kitchen work aisle is 42 inches for a single cook and 48 inches for multiple cooks, according to the national kitchen &amp; bath association. This is the recommended height if the kitchen island will be used primarily for food preparation and cooking. Within the design you should leave a gap between the worktop edge on the back run of units and the island’s worktop edge. Leave enough room on all sides to move around — 3 feet of floor space on the ends of the island is good.
