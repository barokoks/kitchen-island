Kitchen table polyamory is a new term even in poly circles. There’s a term for that, too: People who are polyamorous can be heterosexual, lesbian, gay, or bisexual, and relationships between polyamorous people can include combinations of people of different sexual orientations. Sometimes metamours can feel pressured to immediately have a connection, even if it doesn’t feel natural.
