Awesome stylish design kitchen island designs for open concept dining room. You may be tempted to keep the design of the island very similar to the surrounding cabinets, but this can be an opportunity to be more playful. The kitchen is often the heart of the home and a kitchen island takes centre stage in any kitchen. In a small kitchen, there may not be enough room to add seating to an island, but a slim table with a rack for storage beneath can be a great solution instead.
