Bravo�s �Top Chef� and FOX�s �Kitchen Nightmares� Renewed From aceshowbiz.com
It�s crazy to think gordon cancelled kitchen nightmares over one of the restaurants! Why did kitchen nightmares get cancelled? In 2018, it was reported (via mashed.com) that only 15 restaurants out of 77 that gordon fixed on his tv series were still open. So it appears they have been closed since at least june 2020 and they have no plans to reopen.
