Best Gordon Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares episode for From slate.com
Just rewatched the burger kitchen episode. This version is the uk dubbed version of the usa program meaning some episodes are in different order than the usa series and may be edited differently. Owners amy and samy bouzaglo are perhaps the most famous characters on kitchen nightmares, and they never even finished shooting their episode, which still manages to be one of the most shocking — and amusing — in kitchen nightmares history. Stressful restaurants.this time around, gordon tries to fix whole restaurants’ problems instead of just kitchens.
