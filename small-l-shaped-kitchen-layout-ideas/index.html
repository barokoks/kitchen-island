Designing The LShaped Kitchen From stockcabinetexpress.com
Combining open shelving with closed cupboards is often a more realistic solution (especially if your collection of tupperware is as extensive as ours).

Pairing up with the kitchen cabinets that creates the short run in the l, this beautiful yellow kitchen by devol features a wall of internal glass panels, painted and then aged to allow light and reflections to stream into dark corners. A table and chairs fits neatly into the kitchen, while still zoning it off from the rest of the room.
