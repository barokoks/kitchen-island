124 Custom Luxury Kitchen Designs (PART 1) From homestratosphere.com
This is a smaller kitchen with only one wall of cabinetry and an island with additional storage space. Designed by claudio celiberti and dubbed the most expensive kitchen in the world, it took more than twelve months to create and was designed to push. Labor is always one of the most expensive parts of any project. If that’s not mind blowing enough, the fiore di cristallo kitchen cost $1.6 million and includes a swarovski crystal chandelier (priced at $42,000), wine climate cabinet, a genuine stone worktop and a crystal island ($59,000).
