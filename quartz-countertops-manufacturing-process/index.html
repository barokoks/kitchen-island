The resin and polymers provide a binding force to the mixture, and pigments are added in to add color. The process starts when pure white quartz is mined from the earth. Manufacturing process quartz is crystalized silicon dioxide, normally white or transparent, its extremely hard and resistant to acids. The process consists of blending pulverized natural stone aggregate with a mix of polymers, removing the air, then heating and shaping the material into slabs that have the hardness and appearance of natural stone.
