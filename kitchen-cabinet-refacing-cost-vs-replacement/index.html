Refacing Hudson Refacing Vs Replacing From stcroixcabinetsolutions.com
The national average cost to reface cabinets is $6,518, with most homeowners spending between $4,214 and $8,110 for a 10′ x 12′ kitchen. It’s certainly true that when compared to kitchen cabinet replacement, refacing can provide equally stunning results quicker and at a much lower price. Cabinet refacing costs 30% to 50% less than a custom cabinet replacement, with most projects ranging between $4,300 and $9,980. This is because cabinet refacing involves leaving the existing cabinet box in place and installing new doors and veneers, which significantly reduces labor requirements and material costs.
