LivingKitchen 2017 Review Best of International Kitchen From homeklondike.site

No detail is overlooked, from the tiny garnishes, to the aromas, the tableware, and lovely flower arrangements. One meal was ordinary but good, one was spectacular, and the most recent was borderline inedible: Got a free dessert instead.
