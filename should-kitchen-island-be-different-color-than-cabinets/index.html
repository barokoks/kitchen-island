Have Fun with Your Kitchen How to Choose A Different From newdimensionsinc.com
I don�t think doing a different kitchen cabinet color on the island is out. Your kitchen island does not have to match. Although matching an island to surrounding cabinets and countertops creates symmetry within a kitchen, using different cabinet colors or different countertops can turn an island into a beautiful focal point that complements the rest of your kitchen. If you want to keep the oven as the feature in the kitchen, then i would do the island in the same cupboards and benches as the rest of the kitchen.
